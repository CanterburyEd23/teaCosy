### About

This is a project to build a front-page for a fictional Tea Room company to a design spec as part of the Full Stack Engineer course on Codecademy.  This is primarily to demonstrate an understanding of CSS flexboxes, and represents my first attempt to build flexboxes into a page without having my hand held.  However, due to very exact design specs, this page will not resize well or display well on mobile devices or smaller screens.  This could have been solved if the specs had given measurements in percentages instead of pixels.

Placing the content into the page ended up being very simple, but getting all of the flex rules to work as intended took a little more effort.  This project taught me a lot about styling using them!

### Technology

This page is written in HTML with CSS (with an emphasis on flex boxes) and was created using Git versioning technology.
