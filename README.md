### About

This is a project to build a front-page for a fictional Tea Room company to a design spec as part of the Full Stack Engineer course on Codecademy.  This is primarily to demonstrate an understanding of CSS flexboxes, and represents my first attempt to build flexboxes into a page without being handheld.

### Technology

This page is written in HTML with CSS (with an emphasis on flex boxes) and was created using Git versioning technology.
